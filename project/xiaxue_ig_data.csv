.
I’m never living without tinsel strands in my hair again. Never. You understand me? NEVER EVER. 🤩 These iridescent babies can now withstand heat (I did them years ago and they melted on the curling iron) so you can straighten or tong them. It might be the best invention in the world, even better than... say... airfryers. #iknowright They are individually knotted on single strands of hair and has lasted me more than a month now. Super comfortable too. Got them done at @glitaf. Yes it looks fucking nice even on black hair, go to their ig to see. Let the tsunami of customers begin, @cleokim. 😅"

12,https://www.instagram.com/p/Bdz1w7tn-sp/?taken-by=xiaxue,"For the past week I've been trying out L'Oréal Paris' Revitalift Micro-Essence Water, which #RepairsFromTheFirstDrop! 💧 This is quite a unique product because it isn't a toner or a moisturiser or a serum per se... It's texture is actually more like... water? The Revitalift Micro-Essence Water has 5x smaller droplets for instant hydration and deeper penetration into skin layers... And it contains 92% Pure Centella Essence to deeply repair! If you didn't know, Centella Asiatica is a trending ingredient that is commonly used for its healing and anti-inflammatory properties, great for anti-aging!
.
Here's my verdict after a week of nonstop usage: I love it! ❤️ It absorbs really fast into skin and almost immediately feels like skin has been plumped? My skin has been feeling very... rough lately, like it doesn't have enough elasticity somehow. Glad I tried this new product and it really made a difference! It also has a pleasantly light fragrance.
.
You can use the Micro-Essence Water with moisturiser but I truly felt there was no need to (saves me time!), by itself it is already very hydrating and definitely makes my skin more dewy/glowy and it feels so much more bouncy with fine lines lessened! At night I pair it with a light touch of Revitalift Night Cream, because I sleep with aircon which really dries out my skin.
.
You can also use the Micro-Essence Water as a mask or on your neck. Best thing of all... It is really really affordable at only $29.90, available at all leading drugstores and departmental stores. If you guys try it, let me know if you like it as much as I do!

1) it’s only 45 Min from sg... fuss free! Nearest holiday that you can get that’s out of the country I think!
2) i wanted to bring Dash on his first ferry ride
3) the resort has its own infinity pool and you don’t even need to get out of it to have a great time, it’s perfect for children so you don’t have to go through city hustle and bustle! Just chillax and let the water monster (Dash) swim all day
4) Big enough for my friends to come too so they all can help me take care of Dash 😁

There’s so many brands now, both old and new, and I LOVEEEEEE bubble tea so I’m super excited that Oh Cha Cha, a famous Taiwanese tea brand, is going to be opening their first outlet at Northpoint #01-01 this Saturday! 😌
.
Went for my tasting session and I am in love with one of their star product, the Jin Xuan Oolong Cheese Tea! 🧀 Oh Cha Cha is the ORIGINAL creator of the Cheese Tea and they’ve perfected the entire experience over almost a decade, from the cheese-to-tea ratio and the optimal way to drink the tea! 😱 To me, the cheese taste isn’t overwhelming, it’s a little like salted caramel cream! They take the quality and experience so seriously that each tea is only brewed once so ensure the fragrance of each leaf is emphasised.
.
When you are a tea lover like I am (I don’t really drink coffee), there are many places to taste artisan western tea but it's harder to find Artisan eastern tea! And now you can at @ohchachasg because other than their star product which is their cheese topping, they also have top quality Chinese teas (with optional toppings according to your preference)!
.
Oh Cha Cha will be selling their top-selling Jin Xuan Oolong Cheese Tea for $1 ONLY (OMG 😱) on this Saturday & Sunday (16 - 17 December). Talk about a good deal!
.
AND AND AND GUESS WHAT? Head down to their store, snap a photo on ig and hashtag #ohchachasg for your chance to win a ticket to Bruno Mars 24K Magic Tour Concert!

If you always wanted to see how eyelid/nose surgery is like, you have to go watch the rare footage now on @clicknetwork... it’s not often you can see surgery in action! It’s super gory though warn you first - no blood or anything but my nose and eyelids do get cut open. 😱 If you want to find out why I’m doing plastic surgery again, how the process goes or see how I look like after, go download the clicknetwork app, or click on the link on my bio to watch now! ☺️ https://youtu.be/G6QTfALTvYE

Ps: this is actually day 8 after my surgery... Yes those are stitches on my eyes and under my nose. I also have stitches in my ear where the cartilage was harvested. I am super pleased with the results. 😊 You guys want me to do a LIVE session tonight to answer plastic surgery questions?
.
Pps: Thanks but no thanks for the unsolicited “you should love yourself” advice I’m bound to get. Save your breath, obviously I love myself, why else would I want to improve myself? You don’t hang a nice painting in a shithole of a house, you only make improvements to something that you already like. To me plastic surgery is like getting a degree. It’s just whether you improve your brain or your appearance - both are more likely than not to improve your life. Plastic surgery isn’t any different from getting braces for crooked teeth, or putting on double eyelid stickers everyday. And no I’m not in pain AT ALL. People are just salty when they see you improve yourself and they are staying stagnant. 💁🏼‍♀️"

I’m going to be a princess I will literally have an emoji for me! 👸🏼 Hehe!! Well some of you asked how the proposal went... ok we were at Windex castle or whatever and he just went down on one knee and I was like 😱 OMG this is it all my bjs finally paid off and he was just like Will you marry me? And I was like YES!!!! Then his stupid security guard kicked me a bit and I was like I MEAN YES YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS. And he gave me the ring oh god the diamond is so big but mostly old you know like it’s passed down a dozen dead duchesses probably. A bit ew if you think about it but it’s got histrionics I think. As he is wearing the ring on me I admit I was just fantasizing about our wedding and I’m just hoping he won’t go bald anytime before the wedding that’s just awful why won’t William just cover his head with his hat the entire time? 😰 Hats! What hats will I wear? Anyways... I’m so filled with joy can’t believe I found the love of my life and am gonna spend the rest of my life with him! It feels just like yesterday that Prince Harry, my Prince Harry, came up to me and said he has yellow fever and loves Japanese girls. I said I’m not Japanese but I can pretend to be and he said go on then so I said Konnichiwa! Sugiru! Itai! and he said that’s good enough and we have become soulmates ever since. I know I know gingers have no souls hey that’s not scientifically proven ok?

Everyone knows Taobao is where you can get the MOST ridiculous deals but 11.11 (11th Nov) is the one day when the sales go INSANE! 😱 It's like China's version of Black Friday! The latest Pockit Stroller model is only RMB 1,799 (SGD 370), discounted from the original price of RMB 3,999 (SGD 822). 😱😱

Dash is already 4.5 years old and he doesn't usually use a pram but I still keep mine in my car just in case we need to walk somewhere far... and honestly I love my old stroller and it has served me really well over the years plus it is actually one of the smaller ones, but the size disparity is so big! 😱 The Pockit stroller isn't so suitable for newborns (can't lie completely flat and not as steady) but it's great for toddlers especially for travelling! I'm bringing Dash to Osaka and Universal Studios Japan soon so I'm definitely bringing it - and putting it in the overhead luggage compartment! Go to Tmall now to get your awesome 11.11 deals!

Will I get scolded again? Then I realized I was being stupid... We live in Singapore and we don't indulge in American SJW nonsense like that. It actually does nothing but divide people into tribal groups and mask it under so called ""sensitivity"". It's cultural APPRECIATION not appropriation. Guess who didn't want their country and culture shared? NAZIS. So to all my Indian followers - hope you guys had a great day celebrating the Festival of Light 🕯😊"

I will be there too so please come and support, it will be very fun I promise! 😆
.
More event info here: http://bit.do/dollywinkhalloween
.
There is a registration fee of $18 but you will receive a Halloween goodie bag worth more than $40! There will be Halloween themed games (a haunted house!) + tons of prizes to be won… INCLUDING $800 WORTH OF TRAVEL VOUCHERS FOR THE BEST DRESSED!! The place is air conditioned so come dressed outrageously!
.
I created this quick Anna (Frozen) look with Dolly Wink’s new launches! ❄️ As you guys know I love Dolly Wink especially their lashes, mascara and eyeliners - and they have NEW 3D lashes + super waterproof liquid and GEL eyeliners!
.
I’m also giving away a hamper worth $100 😱😱😱 from Dollywink for a lucky winner reading this! Comment and simply tag 3 friends you want to go with and tell them why!
.
3D falsies are all the rage now! The difference with 3D lashes is that when you look at the lashes from the side, the lashes don’t look uniform and flat, but instead each individual lash has a different curvature, resulting in more natural-looking lashes!
.
Other than the 3D lashes, I’m using Lash 29 in Pure Dolly, which has a solid core(the lash band). The solid cores will help single eyelids become double eyelids by supporting the eyelids!! 😱
.
I LOVE their new gel liners too! I’m using black on top lids and brown on bottom. The gel liners are water-proof, smudge-proof, super easy to draw and WOW ARE THE COLOURS INTENSE - the black is super black!
.
The liquid eyeliners also come in black and brown. I actually used the brown one to draw my Anna freckles on! They are super waterproof and will stay on despite sweat, tears, or sebum.

Now to answer the question you all want to know... Yes that's Qiu. Yes we met each other at the party. Yes it was boring and civil like how you expect adults to behave. No there was no yanking of hair (extensions) or cat fights.

I suppose some of these followers are real since the video has gone quite viral in Indonesia (hi new Indo followers!) but cannot be so many omg
.
Ironically this little clip was part of my original recording with @deekosh but didn't make it in (video was too long as it is).
.
So here you go, I actually predicted the future. 😂 And no, this is not some evil mastermind diabolical plan of mine so I can now buy followers and blame it on saboteurs although I must say if I had came up with that it's really smart. 🤔 But no I already made it known to the world I've got stage 3 #instacancer so too late for fake followers now I guess. #notsuretolaughorcry
.
You know I actually wanted to organize an #instacancer deathday party to ironically celebrate hitting 599k but I guess this anonymous donor of fake followers delayed my party for a bit. Ok then. I'll just enjoy my stay at the over 600k club for a bit longer. Since you are so benevolent, why don't you buy me more till I hit 1m? Might as well right? 😂

Picosure targets acne scars, pores, wrinkles, pigmentation and tattoo can be removed safely and painlessly with no downtime. How great is that? And Sculpsure removes stubborn fat with only 1-2 treatments - look at the difference! So happy because those are two areas I really needed help with - recently been getting loads of zits and gaining weight! 😞

The doctor @dryannixu was very meticulous and attentive throughout the treatments. She made everything very comfortable for me! I actually also did some Botox and fillers with her and will show you guys the before and after!

121,https://www.instagram.com/p/BYF_eKgBDld/?taken-by=xiaxue,"SHIT JUST GOT REAL...I just found out from my latest @tktrichokare treatment that my actual hair age is 46 years old when I'm only 33?! 😱😭😭 The certified Trichologist did the Advanced Tricho Hair Test and explained that it was due to bleaching and dyeing which causes me to have a sensitive, dry and flaky scalp which triggers inflammation, itching and impedes hair growth. 😔 STILL, I'm very happy to say that I can still continue to bleach my hair to any unicorn colour because I have #TrichoKare to help me tackle all my concerns! 🌈
.
Just tried their Advanced Age Defying Hair Treatment... It features the latest Oxyjet technology, which helps to reactivate up to 80% of dormant hair follicles, accelerate cell regeneration to stimulate hair growth, boost collagen and melanin production to prevent greying hair and reduce hair loss.
.
After a 2hr pampering hair session which includes the best scalp massage, the result is clear: my scalp feels so fresh and well-cleansed! No more dandruff!! Yayyy. Also, it helps to increase hair growth and reduces premature grey hair. .
I’m always impressed by the results from TrichoKare customised hair treatment. It has continued to show great results for my scalp and hair! Guess I can try to look as young as possible before a head full of white hairs! 👵🏼
.
Plus, they have outlets conveniently located near MRT stations, so there really isn’t an excuse not to try them out right?
.
A healthy clean scalp prevents future hair loss. If you have hair loss or scalp problems and want to do something about it before it's too late, good news!

I'm so excited to finally witness monster trucks for real, something I always see on Dash's cartoons but thought I'd never see irl.

So many happy little boys there - finally an event just perfect for them!"
