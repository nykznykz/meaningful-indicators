.
I’m never living without tinsel strands in my hair again. Never. You understand me? NEVER EVER. 🤩 These iridescent babies can now withstand heat (I did them years ago and they melted on the curling iron) so you can straighten or tong them. It might be the best invention in the world, even better than... say... airfryers. #iknowright They are individually knotted on single strands of hair and has lasted me more than a month now. Super comfortable too. Got them done at @glitaf. Yes it looks fucking nice even on black hair, go to their ig to see. Let the tsunami of customers begin, @cleokim. 😅",xiaxue_3.jpg

12,https://www.instagram.com/p/Bdz1w7tn-sp/?taken-by=xiaxue,"For the past week I've been trying out L'Oréal Paris' Revitalift Micro-Essence Water, which #RepairsFromTheFirstDrop! 💧 This is quite a unique product because it isn't a toner or a moisturiser or a serum per se... It's texture is actually more like... water? The Revitalift Micro-Essence Water has 5x smaller droplets for instant hydration and deeper penetration into skin layers... And it contains 92% Pure Centella Essence to deeply repair! If you didn't know, Centella Asiatica is a trending ingredient that is commonly used for its healing and anti-inflammatory properties, great for anti-aging!
.
Here's my verdict after a week of nonstop usage: I love it! ❤️ It absorbs really fast into skin and almost immediately feels like skin has been plumped? My skin has been feeling very... rough lately, like it doesn't have enough elasticity somehow. Glad I tried this new product and it really made a difference! It also has a pleasantly light fragrance.
.
You can use the Micro-Essence Water with moisturiser but I truly felt there was no need to (saves me time!), by itself it is already very hydrating and definitely makes my skin more dewy/glowy and it feels so much more bouncy with fine lines lessened! At night I pair it with a light touch of Revitalift Night Cream, because I sleep with aircon which really dries out my skin.
.
You can also use the Micro-Essence Water as a mask or on your neck. Best thing of all... It is really really affordable at only $29.90, available at all leading drugstores and departmental stores. If you guys try it, let me know if you like it as much as I do!

1) it’s only 45 Min from sg... fuss free! Nearest holiday that you can get that’s out of the country I think!
2) i wanted to bring Dash on his first ferry ride
3) the resort has its own infinity pool and you don’t even need to get out of it to have a great time, it’s perfect for children so you don’t have to go through city hustle and bustle! Just chillax and let the water monster (Dash) swim all day
4) Big enough for my friends to come too so they all can help me take care of Dash 😁

There’s so many brands now, both old and new, and I LOVEEEEEE bubble tea so I’m super excited that Oh Cha Cha, a famous Taiwanese tea brand, is going to be opening their first outlet at Northpoint #01-01 this Saturday! 😌
.
Went for my tasting session and I am in love with one of their star product, the Jin Xuan Oolong Cheese Tea! 🧀 Oh Cha Cha is the ORIGINAL creator of the Cheese Tea and they’ve perfected the entire experience over almost a decade, from the cheese-to-tea ratio and the optimal way to drink the tea! 😱 To me, the cheese taste isn’t overwhelming, it’s a little like salted caramel cream! They take the quality and experience so seriously that each tea is only brewed once so ensure the fragrance of each leaf is emphasised.
.
When you are a tea lover like I am (I don’t really drink coffee), there are many places to taste artisan western tea but it's harder to find Artisan eastern tea! And now you can at @ohchachasg because other than their star product which is their cheese topping, they also have top quality Chinese teas (with optional toppings according to your preference)!
.
Oh Cha Cha will be selling their top-selling Jin Xuan Oolong Cheese Tea for $1 ONLY (OMG 😱) on this Saturday & Sunday (16 - 17 December). Talk about a good deal!
.
AND AND AND GUESS WHAT? Head down to their store, snap a photo on ig and hashtag #ohchachasg for your chance to win a ticket to Bruno Mars 24K Magic Tour Concert!

If you always wanted to see how eyelid/nose surgery is like, you have to go watch the rare footage now on @clicknetwork... it’s not often you can see surgery in action! It’s super gory though warn you first - no blood or anything but my nose and eyelids do get cut open. 😱 If you want to find out why I’m doing plastic surgery again, how the process goes or see how I look like after, go download the clicknetwork app, or click on the link on my bio to watch now! ☺️ https://youtu.be/G6QTfALTvYE

Ps: this is actually day 8 after my surgery... Yes those are stitches on my eyes and under my nose. I also have stitches in my ear where the cartilage was harvested. I am super pleased with the results. 😊 You guys want me to do a LIVE session tonight to answer plastic surgery questions?
.
Pps: Thanks but no thanks for the unsolicited “you should love yourself” advice I’m bound to get. Save your breath, obviously I love myself, why else would I want to improve myself? You don’t hang a nice painting in a shithole of a house, you only make improvements to something that you already like. To me plastic surgery is like getting a degree. It’s just whether you improve your brain or your appearance - both are more likely than not to improve your life. Plastic surgery isn’t any different from getting braces for crooked teeth, or putting on double eyelid stickers everyday. And no I’m not in pain AT ALL. People are just salty when they see you improve yourself and they are staying stagnant. 💁🏼‍♀️",xiaxue_30.jpg

And I was like YES!!!! Then his stupid security guard kicked me a bit and I was like I MEAN YES YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS. And he gave me the ring oh god the diamond is so big but mostly old you know like it’s passed down a dozen dead duchesses probably. A bit ew if you think about it but it’s got histrionics I think. As he is wearing the ring on me I admit I was just fantasizing about our wedding and I’m just hoping he won’t go bald anytime before the wedding that’s just awful why won’t William just cover his head with his hat the entire time? 😰 Hats! What hats will I wear? Anyways... I’m so filled with joy can’t believe I found the love of my life and am gonna spend the rest of my life with him! It feels just like yesterday that Prince Harry, my Prince Harry, came up to me and said he has yellow fever and loves Japanese girls. I said I’m not Japanese but I can pretend to be and he said go on then so I said Konnichiwa! Sugiru! Itai! and he said that’s good enough and we have become soulmates ever since.
