NEVER EVER. 🤩 These iridescent babies can now withstand heat (I did them years ago and they melted on the curling iron) so you can straighten or tong them. It might be the best invention in the world, even better than... say... airfryers. #iknowright They are individually knotted on single strands of hair and has lasted me more than a month now. Super comfortable too. Got them done at @glitaf. Yes it looks fucking nice even on black hair, go to their ig to see. Let the tsunami of customers begin, @cleokim. 😅\n",

      "For the past week I've been trying out L'Oréal Paris' Revitalift Micro-Essence Water, which #RepairsFromTheFirstDrop! 💧 This is quite a unique product because it isn't a toner or a moisturiser or a serum per se... It's texture is actually more like... water? The Revitalift Micro-Essence Water has 5x smaller droplets for instant hydration and deeper penetration into skin layers... And it contains 92% Pure Centella Essence to deeply repair! If you didn't know, Centella Asiatica is a trending ingredient that is commonly used for its healing and anti-inflammatory properties, great for anti-aging!\n",
      ".\n",
      "Here's my verdict after a week of nonstop usage: I love it! ❤️ It absorbs really fast into skin and almost immediately feels like skin has been plumped? My skin has been feeling very... rough lately, like it doesn't have enough elasticity somehow. Glad I tried this new product and it really made a difference! It also has a pleasantly light fragrance.\n",
      ".\n",
      "You can use the Micro-Essence Water with moisturiser but I truly felt there was no need to (saves me time!), by itself it is already very hydrating and definitely makes my skin more dewy/glowy and it feels so much more bouncy with fine lines lessened! At night I pair it with a light touch of Revitalift Night Cream, because I sleep with aircon which really dries out my skin.\n",
      ".\n",
      "You can also use the Micro-Essence Water as a mask or on your neck. Best thing of all... It is really really affordable at only $29.90, available at all leading drugstores and departmental stores. If you guys try it, let me know if you like it as much as I do!\n",

You don’t hang a nice painting in a shithole of a house, you only make improvements to something that you already like. To me plastic surgery is like getting a degree. It’s just whether you improve your brain or your appearance - both are more likely than not to improve your life. Plastic surgery isn’t any different from getting braces for crooked teeth, or putting on double eyelid stickers everyday. And no I’m not in pain AT ALL. People are just salty when they see you improve yourself and they are staying stagnant. 💁🏼‍♀️\n",

And I was like YES!!!! Then his stupid security guard kicked me a bit and I was like I MEAN YES YOUR ROYAL HIGHNESS. And he gave me the ring oh god the diamond is so big but mostly old you know like it’s passed down a dozen dead duchesses probably. A bit ew if you think about it but it’s got histrionics I think. As he is wearing the ring on me I admit I was just fantasizing about our wedding and I’m just hoping he won’t go bald anytime before the wedding that’s just awful why won’t William just cover his head with his hat the entire time? 😰 Hats! What hats will I wear? Anyways... I’m so filled with joy can’t believe I found the love of my life and am gonna spend the rest of my life with him! It feels just like yesterday that Prince Harry, my Prince Harry, came up to me and said he has yellow fever and loves Japanese girls. I said I’m not Japanese but I can pretend to be and he said go on then so I said Konnichiwa! Sugiru! Itai! and he said that’s good enough and we have become soulmates ever since.

It's the school that asked the kids to wear a traditional Indian outfit for #deepavali celebration but as I put the outfit on Dash I couldn't help but think... is this Cultural Appropriation? Will I get scolded again? Then I realized I was being stupid... We live in Singapore and we don't indulge in American SJW nonsense like that. It actually does nothing but divide people into tribal groups and mask it under so called \"sensitivity\". It's cultural APPRECIATION not appropriation. Guess who didn't want their country and culture shared? NAZIS. So to all my Indian followers - hope you guys had a great day celebrating the Festival of Light 🕯😊\n",

      ".\n",
      "3D falsies are all the rage now! The difference with 3D lashes is that when you look at the lashes from the side, the lashes don’t look uniform and flat, but instead each individual lash has a different curvature, resulting in more natural-looking lashes!\n",
      ".\n",
      "Other than the 3D lashes, I’m using Lash 29 in Pure Dolly, which has a solid core(the lash band). The solid cores will help single eyelids become double eyelids by supporting the eyelids!! 😱\n",

No there was no yanking of hair (extensions) or cat fights.

      "For the past week I've been trying out L'Oréal Paris' Revitalift Micro-Essence Water, which #RepairsFromTheFirstDrop! 💧 This is quite a unique product because it isn't a toner or a moisturiser or a serum per se... It's texture is actually more like... water? The Revitalift Micro-Essence Water has 5x smaller droplets for instant hydration and deeper penetration into skin layers... And it contains 92% Pure Centella Essence to deeply repair! If you didn't know, Centella Asiatica is a trending ingredient that is commonly used for its healing and anti-inflammatory properties, great for anti-aging!\n",
      ".\n",
      "Here's my verdict after a week of nonstop usage: I love it! ❤️ It absorbs really fast into skin and almost immediately feels like skin has been plumped? My skin has been feeling very... rough lately, like it doesn't have enough elasticity somehow. Glad I tried this new product and it really made a difference! It also has a pleasantly light fragrance.\n",
      ".\n",
      "You can use the Micro-Essence Water with moisturiser but I truly felt there was no need to (saves me time!), by itself it is already very hydrating and definitely makes my skin more dewy/glowy and it feels so much more bouncy with fine lines lessened! At night I pair it with a light touch of Revitalift Night Cream, because I sleep with aircon which really dries out my skin.\n",
      ".\n",
      "You can also use the Micro-Essence Water as a mask or on your neck. Best thing of all... It is really really affordable at only $29.90, available at all leading drugstores and departmental stores. If you guys try it, let me know if you like it as much as I do!\n",

It’s just whether you improve your brain or your appearance - both are more likely than not to improve your life. Plastic surgery isn’t any different from getting braces for crooked teeth, or putting on double eyelid stickers everyday. And no I’m not in pain AT ALL.

      "----------------------\n",
      "For the past week I've been trying out L'Oréal Paris' Revitalift Micro-Essence Water, which #RepairsFromTheFirstDrop! 💧 This is quite a unique product because it isn't a toner or a moisturiser or a serum per se... It's texture is actually more like... water? The Revitalift Micro-Essence Water has 5x smaller droplets for instant hydration and deeper penetration into skin layers... And it contains 92% Pure Centella Essence to deeply repair! If you didn't know, Centella Asiatica is a trending ingredient that is commonly used for its healing and anti-inflammatory properties, great for anti-aging!\n",
      ".\n",
      "Here's my verdict after a week of nonstop usage: I love it! ❤️ It absorbs really fast into skin and almost immediately feels like skin has been plumped? My skin has been feeling very... rough lately, like it doesn't have enough elasticity somehow. Glad I tried this new product and it really made a difference! It also has a pleasantly light fragrance.\n",
      ".\n",
      "You can use the Micro-Essence Water with moisturiser but I truly felt there was no need to (saves me time!), by itself it is already very hydrating and definitely makes my skin more dewy/glowy and it feels so much more bouncy with fine lines lessened! At night I pair it with a light touch of Revitalift Night Cream, because I sleep with aircon which really dries out my skin.\n",
      ".\n",
      "You can also use the Micro-Essence Water as a mask or on your neck. Best thing of all... It is really really affordable at only $29.90, available at all leading drugstores and departmental stores. If you guys try it, let me know if you like it as much as I do!\n",

      ".\n",
      "Other than the 3D lashes, I’m using Lash 29 in Pure Dolly, which has a solid core(the lash band). The solid cores will help single eyelids become double eyelids by supporting the eyelids!! 😱\n",
